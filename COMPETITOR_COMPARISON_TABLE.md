## SALES TALKING POINTS

### When Competing with ChatGPT/Claude

**Price Objection:**

**Feature Objection:**
- "ChatGPT/Claude are general-purpose AI assistants. We're your business co-founder. We remember your failures so they never happen again. We support your entire business journey, not just code."

**Brand Objection:**
- "ChatGPT/Claude have brand recognition, but they don't have guarantees. They don't have institutional memory. They don't support your entire business journey. We do."

---

### When Competing with Cursor

**Price Objection:**
- "Yes, Cursor is $20/month and our Pro+ tier is $79/month. But Pro+ includes everything Cursor does PLUS business operations, venture strategy, and guarantees. Our Pro tier at $29/month is closer in price and includes business features Cursor doesn't have."

**Feature Objection:**
- "Cursor focuses on code. We go beyond code. We support your entire business journey—operations, strategy, and growth. We're your business co-founder, not just your coding assistant."

**Integration Objection:**
- "Cursor has great IDE integration. So do we (Pro+ tier). But we also have CI/CD integration, business operations, and venture strategy tools. We're more comprehensive."

---

### When Competing with Jasper

**Price Objection:**
- "We're actually more affordable—$29/month vs $49/month. And we're more comprehensive. We do content, code, operations, and strategy. Jasper focuses on content."

- "Jasper focuses on content generation. We do content PLUS code, operations, and strategy. We're your business co-founder, not just your content assistant."
