# Cursor Venture Companion

**AI cofounder for the entire product lifecycle**

Cursor Venture Companion is a platform-agnostic AI assistant that helps you through every stage of venture and project development:

- **Ideation & Specification**: From ideas → problem statements, personas, RFCs, architecture docs
- **Implementation**: Scaffold projects, modules, tests, CI/CD, infrastructure templates
- **DevOps & LLMOps**: Monitor repo status, test flakiness, error logs, metrics; propose and implement fixes
- **Continuous Evolution**: Recurring cycles of scanning repo/metrics → detecting opportunities → proposing changes → implementing improvements
- **Business & Product Operations**: Industry-agnostic support for roadmap planning, feature prioritization, and strategic decisions
