# GTM Strategy: Survives Contact with Real Humans

**Last Updated:** $(date)  
**Standard:** A skeptical founder/EM/CTO can understand, trust, and adopt without explanation

---

## ICP Lock

### Primary Launch ICP

**Who:**
- Technical leads, Engineering Managers, CTOs
- At seed/Series A startups (5-50 employees)
- Who write RFCs, specs, and technical plans regularly
- Who are frustrated with rewriting prompts for AI tools

**Demographics:**
- Role: Technical leadership (CTO, EM, Tech Lead)
- Company Stage: Seed to Series A
- Team Size: 5-50 engineers
- Stack: Modern (React, Node, Python, etc.)

**Psychographics:**
- Values efficiency and automation
- Frustrated with repetitive prompt engineering
- Wants structured outputs (not just chat)
- Cares about production safety

### Trigger Moment

**What Just Went Wrong:**
- "I spent 2 hours rewriting the same context for ChatGPT to draft an RFC"
- "My team keeps asking me to share prompts I've written"
- "I'm tired of copy-pasting my role, stack, and context into every AI conversation"
- "I need structured outputs (RFCs, specs) but ChatGPT gives me chat"

**Buying Fear:**
- "I'm wasting hours on prompt engineering when I should be building"
- "My team is inefficient because we're all rewriting the same prompts"
- "I can't scale my prompt engineering knowledge across the team"

**Pain Point:**
- Writing the same context over and over for AI tools
- No way to personalize AI outputs automatically
- No structured outputs (just chat)
- No way to share prompts across team

### Everyone Else Is Ignored

**Not For:**
- ❌ General developers (use ChatGPT/Claude)
- ❌ Non-technical users (too complex)
- ❌ Enterprise (not ready yet)
- ❌ Hobbyists (not willing to pay)

**Why Narrow:**
- Easier to explain value to one ICP
- Clearer messaging
- Better product-market fit
- Higher conversion rates

## Content & Distribution (No Fantasy Channels)

### Founder-Led Narrative Strategy

**Core Narrative:**
"I spent 10 hours last week rewriting prompts. Built this to fix it."

**Key Messages:**
1. **Problem:** "I was wasting hours rewriting the same context for ChatGPT"
2. **Solution:** "Built a tool that assembles personalized prompts automatically"
3. **Outcome:** "Saves me 10+ hours/month, generates production-ready RFCs in 30 seconds"

### Developer-Native Channels Only

**No Paid Ads** (until ROI is provable)

**Channels:**

1. **Product Hunt Launch**
   - Launch day: Tuesday or Wednesday
   - Prep: Build email list, get upvotes ready
   - Goal: Top 5 product of the day

2. **Hacker News (Show HN)**
   - Post: "Show HN: Stop rewriting prompts—personalized AI outputs"
   - Time: 9-10 AM PT (peak traffic)
   - Goal: Front page, 100+ upvotes

3. **Indie Hackers**
   - Post: "How I Built a Prompt Engineering Tool"
   - Share: Metrics, learnings, challenges
   - Goal: 50+ comments, 20+ upvotes

4. **Dev.to**
   - Article: "How I Saved 10 Hours/Week on Prompt Engineering"
   - Include: Before/after, demo, code examples
   - Goal: 500+ views, 50+ reactions

5. **LinkedIn**
   - Posts: Founder-led narrative
   - Frequency: 2-3x per week
   - Goal: 100+ reactions per post

6. **Twitter/X**
   - Short demos: Before/after screenshots
   - Frequency: Daily
   - Goal: 50+ retweets per post

### Content Examples

#### LinkedIn Post (Founder-Led)

> "I was spending 2-3 hours/week rewriting the same context for ChatGPT.
>
> 'I'm a CTO at a SaaS startup. We use React, Node, Supabase. I need an RFC for SSO...'
>
> Built [Product] to assemble personalized prompts automatically.
>
> Now: Type 'Draft RFC for SSO' → Get production-ready RFC in 30 seconds.
>
> Saves me 10+ hours/month.
>
> Demo: [link]
>
> Built in 2 weeks. Launching next week."

#### Twitter/X Demo

> "Before: Copy-paste role, stack, context → Rewrite for each task → 30 min per RFC
>
> After: Type 'Draft RFC for SSO' → Get production-ready RFC in 30 seconds
>
> Built [Product] to stop rewriting prompts.
>
> Launch: [link]"

#### Dev.to Article

**Title:** "How I Saved 10 Hours/Week on Prompt Engineering"

**Outline:**
1. Problem: Rewriting prompts is time-consuming
2. Solution: Automated prompt assembly
3. Demo: Before/after
4. Technical details: How it works
5. Results: Time saved, quality improved
6. Launch: Try it free
