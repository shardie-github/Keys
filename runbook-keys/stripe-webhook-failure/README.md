## Immediate Safety Checks (First 2 Minutes)

**DO THESE FIRST:**

1. **Check if webhook endpoint is responding**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/stripe \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"test": true}'
   ```
   - If returns 500: Continue with this runbook
   - If returns 404: Check deployment (use: Deployment Failure Runbook)
   - If returns 200: Issue may be resolved, verify with Stripe dashboard

2. **Verify environment variables are set**
   ```bash
   echo $STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   echo $STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   ```
   - If empty: Set immediately (see: Environment Configuration Runbook)
   - If set: Continue

3. **Check recent deployments**
   - If deployed in last 15 minutes: Consider rollback
   - If no recent deployments: Continue with diagnosis

4. **Check Stripe dashboard for webhook status**
   - Navigate: Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → [Your Endpoint]
   - Check: Recent delivery status
   - If all recent deliveries failed: Continue with diagnosis
   - If some succeeded: Issue may be intermittent

**DO NOT:**
- Restart services without checking logs first
- Change webhook secret without verifying current value
- Disable webhooks entirely (breaks subscription updates)
- Make configuration changes without documenting them

---

## Diagnosis Flow

### Step 1: Check Webhook Endpoint Health

**Action**: Verify endpoint is responding

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/stripe \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "test"}'
```

**Expected**: 200 OK or 401 Unauthorized (signature required)

**If 500 Error**:
- Check application logs (see: Log Analysis Jupyter KEY)
- Check database connectivity (see: Database Health Check Runbook)
- Continue to Step 2

**If 200 OK**:
- Issue may be intermittent
- Check Stripe dashboard for recent failures
- If failures exist, continue to Step 2

**If 404 Error**:
- Endpoint not deployed or misconfigured
- See: Deployment Failure Runbook

---

### Step 2: Verify Webhook Secret

**Action**: Compare configured secret with Stripe dashboard

```bash
# Get configured secret (from environment)
echo $STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

# Compare with Stripe Dashboard:
# Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → [Your Endpoint] → Signing secret
```

**Expected**: Secrets match exactly

**If Mismatch**:
- Update secret in environment
- Restart application
- Verify webhook delivery resumes
- **STOP HERE** - Issue resolved

**If Match**:
- Continue to Step 3

---

### Step 3: Analyze Recent Webhook Events

**Action**: Use Jupyter KEY to analyze webhook event patterns

- **KEY**: `jupyter-webhook-event-analysis`
- **Input**: Last 24 hours of webhook logs (export from Stripe dashboard)
- **Review**: Failure patterns, error types, timing

**Steps**:
1. Export webhook logs from Stripe dashboard:
   - Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → [Your Endpoint] → Export logs
   - Save as: `webhook_logs_$(date +%Y%m%d).csv`

2. Run Jupyter KEY:
   - Open: `/jupyter-keys/webhook-event-analysis/webhook-event-analysis.ipynb`
   - Input: `webhook_logs_YYYYMMDD.csv`
   - Execute all cells

3. Review output:
   - Delivery success rate (should be > 95%)
   - Failure patterns (which events fail most)
   - Timing patterns (when failures occur)
   - Error types (signature, timeout, processing)

**Expected**: Clear pattern of failures

**If Pattern Found**:
- Follow pattern-specific resolution steps
- Document pattern for future prevention

**If No Pattern**:
- Continue to Step 4

---

### Step 4: Check Application Logs

**Action**: Review application logs for webhook processing errors

```bash
# Filter logs for webhook errors
grep -i "webhook" /var/log/app.log | tail -100

# Or use log aggregation tool
# Filter: endpoint="/api/webhooks/stripe" AND status=500
```

**Expected**: Specific error messages

**If Database Errors**:
- See: Database Connection Failure Runbook

**If Signature Errors**:
- See: Webhook Signature Verification Runbook

**If Processing Errors**:
- Continue to Step 5

**If No Errors Found**:
- Check if logs are being written
- Verify log level is set correctly
- Continue to Step 5

---

### Step 5: Test Webhook Processing

**Action**: Send test webhook event

```bash
# Use Stripe CLI to send test event
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded \
  --override webhook-endpoint-url=https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/stripe
```

**Expected**: Event processed successfully

**If Fails**:
- Check error message
- Follow error-specific resolution steps
- See Action Steps section

**If Succeeds**:
- Issue may be resolved
- Monitor for recurrence
- **STOP HERE** - Issue resolved

---

## Action Steps

### Action 1: Update Webhook Secret (REVERSIBLE)

**Precondition**: Verified secret mismatch in Step 2

**Action**:
```bash
# 1. Get new secret from Stripe Dashboard
# Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → [Your Endpoint] → Reveal signing secret

# 2. Update environment variable
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_new_secret_here"

# 3. Update in your environment configuration
# For Vercel: Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
# For Railway: Railway Dashboard → Variables
# For local: .env.local file

# 4. Restart application
pm2 restart app
# OR
systemctl restart your-app
# OR (Vercel)
# Redeploy automatically triggers restart
```

**Expected**: Webhook endpoint accepts new signatures

**Verification**:
```bash
# Send test webhook
stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded \
  --override webhook-endpoint-url=https://your-app.com/api/webhooks/stripe

# Check logs for successful processing
tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep "webhook.*processed"
```

**Rollback**: Restore previous secret if issue persists

---

### Action 2: Replay Failed Webhook Events (REVERSIBLE)

**Precondition**: Identified failed events in Step 3

**Automated (Preferred)**:
- **KEY**: `node-stripe-webhook-replay`
- **Location**: `/node-keys/stripe-webhook-replay/src/index.ts`

**Execution**:
```typescript
import { replayFailedWebhooks } from '@/node-keys/stripe-webhook-replay/src';

// Replay events from last 24 hours
await replayFailedWebhooks({
  startTime: new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000),
  endpoint: '/api/webhooks/stripe',
  dryRun: false, // Set to true to preview without executing
});
```

**Manual Alternative (If Automation Fails)**:
```bash
# 1. Get failed events from Stripe Dashboard
# Stripe Dashboard → Developers → Webhooks → [Your Endpoint] → Failed events

# 2. Replay each event manually
stripe events resend evt_1234567890
stripe events resend evt_0987654321
# ... repeat for each failed event ...

# 3. Verify events were processed
# Check application logs for successful processing
tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep "webhook.*processed"
```

**Expected**: Failed events are replayed and processed

**Verification**: Check Stripe dashboard for successful deliveries

**Rollback**: Events are idempotent, no rollback needed

---

### Action 3: Restart Webhook Processing Service (REVERSIBLE)

**Precondition**: Identified service hang or memory leak

**Action**:
```bash
# Graceful restart
pm2 restart app
# OR
systemctl restart your-app

# Wait for service to be healthy
sleep 10
curl https://your-app.com/health
```

**Expected**: Service restarts and webhooks resume

**Verification**: Monitor webhook delivery in Stripe dashboard

**Rollback**: Service restart is reversible (can restart again if needed)

---

### Action 4: Fix Webhook Processing Code (REVERSIBLE)

**Precondition**: Identified code bug in Step 4

**Action**:
1. Review error logs to identify bug
2. Fix code issue
3. Test locally with Stripe CLI
4. Deploy fix
5. Verify webhook processing resumes

**Expected**: Webhook processing works correctly

**Verification**: Send test webhook and verify processing

**Rollback**: Revert code change and redeploy

---

### Action 5: Disable Webhook Endpoint (IRREVERSIBLE - USE WITH CAUTION)

**Precondition**: All other actions failed, service is unstable

**Warning**: This will stop all subscription updates. Use only as last resort.

**Action**:
```bash
# Comment out webhook route temporarily
# File: app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts
# Comment: export const POST = stripeWebhookHandler;

# Redeploy
git commit -m "Temporarily disable webhook endpoint"
git push
```

**Expected**: Webhook endpoint returns 404

**Verification**: Stripe dashboard shows endpoint unreachable

**Rollback**: Uncomment route and redeploy immediately after fixing root cause

---

## Verification

   - **Success**: Delivery rate > 95%

2. **Monitor Application Logs**
   ```bash
   tail -f /var/log/app.log | grep "webhook"
   ```
   **Success**: No 500 errors, all events processed

3. **Check Error Rate**
   - Monitoring dashboard: `stripe_webhook_error_rate`
   - **Success**: Error rate < 1%

### Final Verification (After 24 Hours)

1. **Review Webhook Delivery Report**
   - Use: `jupyter-webhook-delivery-report` KEY
   - **Success**: All events delivered successfully

2. **Verify Subscription Updates**
   - Check: User subscriptions match Stripe subscriptions
   - **Success**: No discrepancies

3. **Check Alert Status**

## Rollback / Escalation

### When to Rollback

Rollback if:
- Actions made the situation worse
- Error rate increased after actions
- Service became unavailable
- Data corruption detected

### Rollback Procedures

**If Action 1 (Secret Update) Made Things Worse**:
```bash
# Restore previous secret
export STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_previous_secret"
pm2 restart app
```

**If Action 2 (Replay) Caused Issues**:
- Replayed events are idempotent, but check for duplicates
- Review: `jupyter-webhook-duplicate-detection` KEY

**If Action 3 (Restart) Made Things Worse**:
- Check service logs for startup errors
- See: Service Startup Failure Runbook

**If Action 4 (Code Fix) Made Things Worse**:
```bash
# Revert code change
git revert HEAD
git push
```

**If Action 5 (Disable) Was Applied**:
```bash
# Re-enable webhook endpoint immediately
# Uncomment route and redeploy
git revert HEAD
git push
```
