## Core Principle

**KEYS PROVIDES EVIDENCE, NOT CERTIFICATION.**

KEYS helps organizations achieve compliance by providing:

- **Change management**: Controlled change processes

KEYS does NOT provide:
- **Certification**: KEYS is not SOC 2 certified (organizations are)
- **Guarantees**: KEYS cannot guarantee compliance (organizations achieve it)
- **Legal advice**: KEYS is not a law firm
