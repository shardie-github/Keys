## 30-SECOND PITCH

"Keys prevents developers from shipping insecure code. We scan every AI-generated output for vulnerabilities, guarantee compliance, and remember every failure so it never happens again. Your institutional memory becomes prevention rules. We're liable if we miss something. Alternatives aren't."

---

## 1-MINUTE PITCH

"Keys prevents developers from shipping insecure code. Here's how:

**The Problem:** Developers use AI to generate code, but AI outputs contain security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and quality problems. One SQL injection can cost $10K-$100K+. One compliance violation can cost $50K-$500K+ in fines.

**The Solution:** Keys scans every AI-generated output for vulnerabilities, guarantees compliance, and remembers every failure so it never happens again. Your institutional memory becomes prevention rules. Your successes become best practices.

**The Moat:** Four defensible moats:
1. **Data Gravity:** Each user accumulates 100+ failure patterns over 6 months. Switching loses 6-24 months of institutional memory.
2. **Risk Transfer:** We accept legal liability for missed vulnerabilities. Competitors can't match without $100K+ setup and 12-18 months.
3. **Workflow Integration:** IDE and CI/CD integrations create daily dependency. Can't deploy without Keys.
4. **Pattern Recognition:** ML-powered pattern matching learns from user-specific failures. Competitors need user's history + ML training.

**The Pricing:** $29/month prevents $10K-$100K+ security incidents. ROI: 190x-1,900x. Price won't collapse because it's anchored to outcomes, not features.

**The Traction:** [Add current metrics]

We're raising [amount] to [use case]."

## FULL PITCH (5 MINUTES)

### The Problem

Developers use AI to generate code faster, but AI outputs contain:
- **Security vulnerabilities:** SQL injection, XSS, secret exposure ($10K-$100K+ per incident)
- **Compliance issues:** GDPR violations, SOC 2 gaps ($50K-$500K+ in fines)
- **Quality problems:** Technical debt, code smells ($5K-$50K+ in refactoring)

**Current solutions fail:**
- Manual code review is slow and error-prone
- Generic security scanners miss context-specific issues
- No institutional memory - teams repeat the same mistakes
- No guarantees - all risk remains with the developer

### The Solution

Keys is an institutional memory system that:
1. **Scans every output** for security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and quality problems
2. **Guarantees outputs** meet standards (we're liable if we miss something)
3. **Remembers failures** so they never happen again (institutional memory)
4. **Integrates into workflows** (IDE, CI/CD) so it's unavoidable

**Value proposition:** $29/month prevents $10K-$100K+ security incidents. ROI: 190x-1,900x.

### The Market

- **TAM:** $50B+ (all developers using AI)
- **SAM:** $10B+ (developers using AI for code generation)
- **SOM:** $100M+ (developers who need security/compliance guarantees)

**Market trends:**
- AI code generation growing 50%+ YoY
- Security incidents increasing 30%+ YoY
- Compliance requirements tightening (GDPR, SOC 2, HIPAA)
- Developer time costs increasing ($100K+/year per developer)

### The Moat

Four defensible moats that compound:

**1. Data Gravity Moat (Irreversible)**
- Each user accumulates 100+ failure patterns over 6 months
- Pattern signatures are user-specific and context-dependent
- Switching cost: User loses 6-24 months of institutional memory
- Replication cost: Competitor needs user's full history + 6-24 months to rebuild

**2. Risk Transfer Moat (Legal/Financial)**
- Keys accepts legal liability for missed vulnerabilities (ToS guarantee)
- Keys provides insurance-backed security guarantees
- Switching cost: User loses liability protection, must self-insure
- Replication cost: $100K+ and 12-18 months minimum (legal structure, insurance, compliance)

**3. Workflow Integration Moat (Operational)**
- IDE extension creates daily dependency (VS Code/Cursor)
- CI/CD integration makes Keys mandatory for deployment
- Switching cost: User loses IDE/CI/CD integration, must rebuild workflows
- Replication cost: 6-12 months per integration

**4. Pattern Recognition Moat (Algorithmic)**
- Pattern signatures learned from user-specific failures
- Similarity thresholds tuned per user over time
- Switching cost: User loses tuned pattern recognition, must retrain
- Replication cost: Competitor needs user's failure history + ML training

**Combined:** No single competitor can replicate all four moats simultaneously. Each moat compounds with others.

### The Business Model

**Pricing Architecture:**
- **Free:** $0/month (50 runs, failure pattern tracking, basic safety checks)
- **Pro:** $29/month (1,000 runs, security/compliance/quality guarantees)
- **Pro+:** $79/month (5,000 runs, IDE/CI/CD integrations, advanced pattern recognition)
- **Enterprise:** $500+/month (unlimited, SLA, legal liability, compliance certifications, usage-based pricing)

**Why Price Won't Collapse:**
1. **Structural cost floor:** $29/month covers insurance ($10K/year), legal ($50K setup), compliance ($50K/year)
2. **Outcome-based pricing:** Users pay for risk transfer ($10K-$100K+ prevented), not features
3. **Data gravity:** Failure patterns accumulate → price elasticity is low
4. **Guarantee moat:** Legal guarantees require $100K+ setup and 12-18 months

**Unit Economics:**
- **CAC:** $50 (content marketing, product-led growth)
- **LTV:** $1,740 (Pro: $29/month × 60 months retention)
- **LTV:CAC:** 35:1
- **Gross Margin:** 75-90% (improves with scale)
- **Payback Period:** <1 month

## FAQ

**Q: Why can't this be copied?**
A: Four moats compound: data (6-24 months per user), guarantees ($100K+ setup), integrations (6-12 months each), patterns (ML training). No single competitor can replicate all simultaneously.

**Q: Why won't price collapse?**
A: Structural cost floor ($29/month covers insurance + legal + compliance). Outcome-based pricing (anchored to $10K-$100K+ prevented). Data gravity (price elasticity is low).

**Q: What happens when AI gets cheaper?**
A: Value migrates from AI to data. Guarantees become premium. Integration depth creates lock-in. Network effects improve with scale.

**Q: What stops a better-funded team?**
A: Time advantage: 6-24 months for data, 12-18 months for guarantees, 6-12 months for integrations. Funding can't shortcut time.

**Q: What happens if the founder disappears?**
A: Automated systems (self-sustaining), data gravity (irreversible value), guarantee structure (institutional), integration depth (operational dependency).
