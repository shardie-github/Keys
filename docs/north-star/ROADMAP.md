# KEYS Roadmap

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-30  
**Purpose**: Reframed roadmap aligned with north-star positioning

---

## Roadmap Philosophy

KEYS roadmap is organized around:
1. **New KEYS** - Adding new keys to unlock tools
2. **Better Discovery** - Helping users find the right keys
3. **Better Bundling** - Combining keys for outcomes
4. **Better Entitlement** - Managing access and updates

**Explicitly Deprioritized**:
- Competing AI features
- Model hosting
- Tool replacement behavior

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current)

### ✅ Complete
- Cursor Keys (prompt packs, Composer instructions)
- Jupyter Keys (notebook marketplace)
- Basic marketplace infrastructure
- Stripe integration for entitlements

### 🔄 In Progress
- North-star alignment (this work)
- Taxonomy implementation
- Language reframing

---

## Phase 2: New KEYS (Next 3 Months)

### Cursor Keys Expansion
- **More Prompt Packs**: Additional Cursor workflow patterns
- **Composer Keys**: More scaffolding instructions
- **Template Keys**: More starter repositories

**Outcome**: Users unlock more Cursor capability

### Jupyter Keys Expansion
- **More Notebook Packs**: Additional data science workflows
- **Validation Harnesses**: Testing and validation patterns
- **Analysis Templates**: Common analysis patterns

**Outcome**: Users unlock more Jupyter capability

### GitHub Keys (New)
- **CI/CD Workflows**: GitHub Actions patterns
- **Repository Templates**: Starter repo structures
- **Issue Management**: Workflow patterns

**Outcome**: Users unlock GitHub automation capability

### Stripe Keys (New)
- **Payment Flows**: Payment processing patterns
- **Subscription Management**: Subscription workflows
- **Webhook Handling**: Webhook processing patterns

**Outcome**: Users unlock Stripe monetization capability

### Supabase Keys (New)
- **RLS Patterns**: Row-level security patterns
- **Auth Flows**: Authentication workflow patterns
- **Real-time Patterns**: Real-time subscription patterns

**Outcome**: Users unlock Supabase backend capability

---

## Phase 3: Better Discovery (3-6 Months)

### Enhanced Search
- **Tool-Based Search**: "Show me all Cursor Keys"
- **Outcome-Based Search**: "Show me all Monetization Keys"
- **Maturity-Based Search**: "Show me all Starter Keys"
- **Cross-Tool Search**: "Show me all keys for building SaaS"

**Outcome**: Users find the right keys faster

### Recommendations
- **Based on Tool Usage**: Recommend keys for tools users already use
- **Based on Outcomes**: Recommend keys for outcomes users are pursuing
- **Based on Maturity**: Recommend keys appropriate for user's skill level

**Outcome**: Users discover keys they didn't know they needed

### Collections
- **Curated Collections**: "Essential Cursor Keys," "SaaS Builder Keys"
- **User Collections**: Users create and share collections
- **Featured Collections**: Highlighted collections by outcome

**Outcome**: Users discover related keys together

---

## Phase 4: Better Bundling (6-9 Months)

### Key Bundles
- **Tool Bundles**: "Complete Cursor Keys Bundle"
- **Outcome Bundles**: "SaaS Builder Bundle" (Stripe + Supabase + GitHub Keys)
- **Maturity Bundles**: "Starter Bundle" (all starter keys)

**Outcome**: Users unlock complete outcomes with one purchase

### Cross-Tool Workflows
- **SaaS Starter**: Stripe + Supabase + GitHub Keys bundled together
- **Data Science Stack**: Jupyter + GitHub Keys bundled together
- **Full-Stack Builder**: Cursor + Supabase + Stripe Keys bundled together

**Outcome**: Users unlock complete stacks, not just individual tools

### Subscription Tiers
- **Pro Library**: Access to all keys via subscription
- **Tool-Specific Tiers**: "All Cursor Keys" subscription
- **Outcome-Specific Tiers**: "All Monetization Keys" subscription

**Outcome**: Users unlock ongoing access to keys

---

## Phase 5: Better Entitlement (9-12 Months)

### Update Management
- **Automatic Updates**: Keys update automatically when new versions are released
- **Update Notifications**: Users notified of key updates
- **Version History**: Users can see and rollback to previous versions

**Outcome**: Users always have the latest keys

### Team Entitlements
- **Organization Sharing**: Teams share key access
- **Team Collections**: Teams create shared collections
- **Usage Analytics**: Teams see how keys are used

**Outcome**: Teams unlock capability together

### Key Analytics
- **Usage Tracking**: See which keys are most used
- **Outcome Tracking**: See which outcomes keys unlock
- **Feedback Loop**: Users provide feedback on keys

**Outcome**: Continuous improvement of keys

---

## Explicitly Deprioritized

### ❌ Competing AI Features
- Building AI models
- Hosting AI services
- Competing with Cursor, Jupyter, etc.

**Rationale**: KEYS unlocks tools; it doesn't compete with them.

### ❌ Model Hosting
- Hosting AI models
- Providing inference services
- Managing model infrastructure

**Rationale**: KEYS provides keys; users use their own tools.

### ❌ Tool Replacement Behavior
- Building tools that replace external tools
- Abstracting away tool usage
- Hiding execution paths

**Rationale**: KEYS shows users how to use tools; it doesn't hide them.

---

## Success Metrics

### Key Metrics
- **Number of Keys**: How many keys are available?
- **Key Usage**: How often are keys used?
- **Outcomes Unlocked**: What outcomes do keys unlock?
- **User Satisfaction**: Are users finding value in keys?

### Discovery Metrics
- **Search Success**: Can users find the keys they need?
- **Recommendation Effectiveness**: Do recommendations lead to key usage?
- **Collection Usage**: Are collections helping users discover keys?

### Bundling Metrics
- **Bundle Adoption**: Are users buying bundles?
- **Cross-Tool Usage**: Are users using keys across multiple tools?
- **Subscription Retention**: Are users maintaining subscriptions?

### Entitlement Metrics
- **Update Adoption**: Are users updating their keys?
- **Team Sharing**: Are teams sharing keys?
- **Feedback Quality**: Is feedback helping improve keys?

## Long-Term Vision (12+ Months)

### Universal Keyring
KEYS becomes the universal keyring for all modern tools:
- Keys for every major tool
- Keys for every common outcome
- Keys for every maturity level

### Community Marketplace
Users contribute keys:
- Community-created keys
- Key ratings and reviews
- Key sharing and collaboration

### Enterprise Features
Enterprise-grade key management:
- SSO integration
- Advanced analytics
- Custom key creation
- White-label options
