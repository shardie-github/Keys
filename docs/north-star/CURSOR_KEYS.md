# Cursor Keys

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2024-12-30  
**Purpose**: Explain how prompts and Composer instructions are keys that unlock Cursor

---

## What Are Cursor Keys?

**Cursor Keys are structured prompt packs and Composer instructions that unlock practical, repeatable capability in Cursor.**

Cursor is a powerful AI-powered code editor. Cursor Keys don't replace Cursor—they unlock advanced workflows, patterns, and capabilities within Cursor.

---

## Why Prompts Are Keys

### The Tool Provides Power
Cursor provides:
- AI-powered code generation
- Context-aware suggestions
- Codebase understanding
- Multi-file editing

### The Key Provides Leverage
Cursor Keys provide:
- Proven prompt patterns
- Structured workflows
- Best practice templates
- Reusable scaffolding instructions

**Without keys**: You write prompts from scratch, reinvent patterns, and miss best practices.  
**With keys**: You unlock proven workflows that produce consistent, high-quality results.

## Cursor Is a Tool, Not a Competitor

### KEYS Doesn't Compete with Cursor
- ❌ KEYS doesn't replace Cursor
- ❌ KEYS doesn't build a competing editor
- ❌ KEYS doesn't hide Cursor's capabilities

### KEYS Amplifies Cursor
- ✅ KEYS provides prompt packs that unlock advanced Cursor workflows
- ✅ KEYS provides Composer instructions that unlock scaffolding patterns
- ✅ KEYS provides templates that unlock consistent code generation

**Metaphor**: Cursor is the power tool. Cursor Keys are the jigs, templates, and guides that help you use it effectively.

## Types of Cursor Keys

### 1. Prompt Packs
**What**: Collections of proven prompts for specific outcomes  
**Format**: YAML files with structured prompt templates  
**Use Case**: Unlock consistent code generation patterns

**Example**: "Cursor Keys: Authentication Scaffolding"
- Provides prompts for JWT middleware generation
- Includes variable substitution for different frameworks
- Unlocks consistent auth patterns across projects

### 2. Composer Keys
**What**: Mega prompts and instructions for Cursor Composer  
**Format**: `.prompt.yaml` files with comprehensive instructions  
**Use Case**: Unlock complex scaffolding workflows

**Example**: "Cursor Keys: Full-Stack SaaS Scaffold"
- Provides comprehensive Composer instructions
- Unlocks entire project scaffolding in one go
- Includes best practices and patterns

### 3. Template Keys
**What**: Starter repositories and code templates  
**Format**: Repository structures, code files  
**Use Case**: Unlock project setup patterns

**Example**: "Cursor Keys: Express + Supabase Starter"
- Provides complete starter repository
- Unlocks proven project structure
- Includes configuration and setup patterns

## How Cursor Keys Work

### 1. User Owns Cursor
The user already has Cursor installed and configured. KEYS doesn't provide Cursor—it provides keys to unlock it.

### 2. User Selects a Key
User browses Cursor Keys in the marketplace:
- "Cursor Keys: Authentication Scaffolding"
- "Cursor Keys: Database Migration Patterns"
- "Cursor Keys: API Route Generation"

### 3. User Applies the Key
User downloads or applies the key:
- Prompt pack → Loads into Cursor's prompt system
- Composer key → Provides instructions for Composer
- Template key → Provides starter code structure

### 4. User Unlocks Capability
User uses Cursor with the key:
- Generates code using proven prompt patterns
- Scaffolds projects using Composer instructions
- Starts projects using template structures

**Result**: User unlocks practical capability in Cursor without reinventing patterns.

---

## Why This Matters

### Without Cursor Keys
- Users write prompts from scratch
- Users reinvent patterns
- Users miss best practices
- Inconsistent results across projects

### With Cursor Keys
- Users unlock proven patterns immediately
- Users leverage best practices
- Consistent results across projects
- Faster time to value

---

## Cursor Keys vs. Generic Prompts

### Generic Prompts
- Vague, one-off instructions
- No structure or reusability
- No best practices embedded
- No versioning or updates

### Cursor Keys
- Structured, reusable patterns
- Best practices embedded
- Versioned and updatable
- Tool-specific optimizations

---

## Examples of Cursor Keys

### Example 1: Authentication Scaffolding
**Key**: "Cursor Keys: JWT Authentication Middleware"  
**What It Unlocks**: Consistent JWT auth patterns in Cursor  
**How**: Provides Composer instructions that generate JWT middleware with best practices

**User Flow**:
1. User selects key in marketplace
2. User applies key to Cursor
3. User uses Composer: "Setup JWT auth"
4. Cursor generates middleware using key's patterns
5. User unlocks consistent auth capability

### Example 2: Database Migrations
**Key**: "Cursor Keys: Supabase Migration Patterns"  
**What It Unlocks**: Consistent migration patterns in Cursor  
**How**: Provides prompt packs that generate migration code with RLS policies

**User Flow**:
1. User selects key in marketplace
2. User loads prompt pack into Cursor
3. User prompts: "Create migration for users table"
4. Cursor generates migration using key's patterns
5. User unlocks consistent migration capability

### Example 3: API Route Generation
**Key**: "Cursor Keys: Express API Routes"  
**What It Unlocks**: Consistent API patterns in Cursor  
**How**: Provides template keys with route structures and patterns

**User Flow**:
1. User selects key in marketplace
2. User applies template to project
3. User uses Cursor to generate routes
4. Cursor follows template patterns
5. User unlocks consistent API capability

## Language Guidelines

### ✅ Use
- "Unlock Cursor workflows"
- "Cursor Keys unlock [outcome]"
- "Keys to Cursor"
- "Unlock capability in Cursor"

### ❌ Avoid
- "AI companion"
- "Cursor replacement"
- "Better than Cursor"
- "AI tool"

---

## Integration with Cursor

### How Keys Integrate
1. **Prompt Packs**: Load into Cursor's prompt system
2. **Composer Keys**: Provide instructions for Composer mode
3. **Template Keys**: Provide starter code structures

### User Experience
- User browses keys in KEYS marketplace
- User selects and applies key
- User uses Cursor with unlocked capability
- User sees consistent, high-quality results

---

## Future of Cursor Keys

### As Cursor Evolves
- New Cursor features → New Cursor Keys unlock them
- Cursor updates → Keys adapt to new capabilities
- Cursor improvements → Keys leverage improvements

### KEYS Stays Above
- KEYS doesn't compete with Cursor
- KEYS doesn't duplicate Cursor features
- KEYS provides keys that unlock Cursor

---

## Summary

**Cursor Keys are structured assets that unlock practical capability in Cursor.**

- Cursor is the tool (power)
- Cursor Keys are the keys (leverage)
- Users own Cursor
- KEYS provides keys to unlock it

**This is not competition. This is amplification.**
