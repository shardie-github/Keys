# Open Source

Keys is an open source knowledge and artifact library. The repository includes prompts, notebooks, and runbooks that are designed to be adapted to your environment.

## License

Keys is published under the repository license. Review the license terms before using artifacts in production or redistributing modified versions.

## Contribution model

We welcome contributions that improve clarity, safety, and usefulness:

- Propose new artifacts with clear metadata and explicit assumptions.
- Submit revisions that tighten instructions, add validation steps, or remove ambiguous language.
- Flag artifacts that are outdated or conflict with newer guidance.

## Review standards

Every contribution is reviewed for:

- Accuracy and practical scope
- Clear inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Safety, security, and privacy considerations
- Reproducibility and maintainability

## Community expectations

Be specific, be respectful, and leave a paper trail. Keys exists to help teams learn and adapt, not to provide one-size-fits-all answers.
