# Enterprise

Keys is open source and can be used directly by any team. Enterprise is an optional, managed distribution for organizations that need centralized access and support.

## What enterprise provides

- Managed distribution of the open source library
- Access controls and workspace provisioning
- Support for procurement, compliance review, and internal onboarding

## What enterprise does not change

- The open source artifacts remain the source of truth.
- Teams still own adaptation and judgment.
- There are no guarantees of outcomes.

If your organization needs a managed distribution, contact the maintainers to discuss scope and support requirements.
