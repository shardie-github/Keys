# Governance

Keys is curated to keep artifacts practical, safe, and adaptable. Governance focuses on transparency, review discipline, and maintenance.

## Curation philosophy

- **Start with reality.** Artifacts should reflect how teams actually work, including constraints and tradeoffs.
- **Prefer clarity over completeness.** A shorter, well-scoped artifact is better than a sprawling template.
- **Design for adaptation.** Every artifact must be easy to fork and modify without hidden dependencies.

## Review process

1. Maintainers verify assumptions, inputs, and expected outputs.
2. Safety, security, and privacy implications are documented.
3. Artifacts are tagged by type, scope, and change history.

## Deprecation and replacement

When an artifact becomes outdated:

- Mark it as deprecated with a reason and a replacement link.
- Keep the original for auditability, but steer users to the updated version.

## Stewardship

Governance is community-first. Major changes are documented in the repo and open to review.
