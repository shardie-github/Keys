# What is Keys

Keys is an open source library of prompts, notebooks, and runbooks for modern software and operations work. It is built to be a starting point, not a final answer.

## How to use Keys responsibly

- **Adapt before you run.** Every artifact includes context and assumptions. Update them for your system, data, and risk tolerance.
- **Use judgment.** Keys does not replace engineering, security, or domain expertise.
- **Review outputs.** Treat generated outputs as drafts that need validation and peer review.
- **Keep a paper trail.** Record what you changed and why so your team can audit decisions.

## What Keys is

- A curated collection of reusable artifacts.
- A shared vocabulary for teams that want consistent prompts, notebooks, and runbooks.
- A community-maintained reference you can fork and improve.

## What Keys is not

- A model or decision engine.
- A guarantee of outcomes.
- A replacement for understanding, testing, or validation.

## Recommended workflow

1. Start with an artifact that matches your situation.
2. Read the assumptions and constraints at the top.
3. Customize it for your environment.
4. Run, review, and iterate with your team.

If you have questions about responsible use, start with the governance and open source pages and follow the contribution guidelines.
