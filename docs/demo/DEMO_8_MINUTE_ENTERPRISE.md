## Demo Script (8 Minutes)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:30)

**Say:**
```
"Thank you for your time. I'm here to show you how KEYS helps enterprise teams 
unlock practical capability in tools you already use—while ensuring compliance, 
reducing risk, and maintaining team consistency.

KEYS is the keyring to modern tools. We provide proven patterns that are 
production-tested, security-reviewed, and compliance-ready. Let me show you 
how this works for enterprise teams."
```

**Do:**
- Open KEYS marketplace
- Navigate to enterprise section or filter by maturity: "enterprise"

---

### Enterprise Problem Statement (0:30 - 1:30)

**Say:**
```
"Enterprise teams face three challenges:

First, compliance and security. Every pattern you use needs to be security-reviewed 
and compliance-ready. Building from scratch means you're responsible for security 
review, compliance validation, and audit trail generation.

Second, team consistency. Different teams build different patterns. That creates 
inconsistency, increases risk, and makes governance difficult.

Third, time and cost. Hiring consultants for every pattern costs $1,200-2,400 
per pattern. Building internally takes 8-16 hours per pattern and requires 
security review and compliance validation.

KEYS solves all three: compliance-ready patterns, standardized workflows, 
and proven implementations that save time and reduce cost."
```

**Do:**
- Show enterprise Key examples
- Point out compliance/security badges or metadata

---

### Show Enterprise Key (1:30 - 3:00)

**Say:**
```
"Let me show you an enterprise Key: Supabase RLS Policy Patterns. This Key 
unlocks row-level security policy patterns for Supabase databases.

Notice what makes this enterprise-ready:

First, compliance documentation. This Key includes GDPR compliance patterns, 
SOC 2 alignment, and audit trail generation. Every pattern is documented 
for compliance review.

Second, security review. This Key has been security-reviewed. It includes 
vulnerability assessments, security best practices, and risk mitigation 
strategies.

Third, audit trails. This Key generates audit trails automatically. You 
can demonstrate compliance, track access patterns, and maintain governance 
records.

Fourth, team consistency. Every team using this Key gets the same proven 
pattern. No variation, no inconsistency, no governance gaps."
```

**Do:**
- Click on enterprise Key
- Show Key detail page
- Point out: compliance documentation, security review, audit trail features
- Show metadata: maturity level (enterprise), compliance tags, security badges

---

### Show Compliance Features (3:00 - 4:30)

**Say:**
```
"Let me show you the compliance features in detail.

Every enterprise Key includes:

Compliance documentation: GDPR patterns, SOC 2 alignment, HIPAA considerations 
where applicable. This documentation is reviewed and updated regularly.

Security review: Every Key undergoes security review before publication. 
Vulnerability assessments, security best practices, and risk mitigation 
strategies are documented.

Audit trail generation: Enterprise Keys generate audit trails automatically. 
You can track who used which pattern, when, and for what purpose. This 
supports compliance audits and governance requirements.

Governance support: Enterprise Keys support organizational governance. You 
can standardize patterns across teams, enforce compliance requirements, and 
maintain consistency.

This isn't just code—it's compliance-ready infrastructure that reduces 
your compliance burden."
```

**Do:**
- Show compliance documentation section
- Show security review details
- Show audit trail examples (if available)
- Show governance features

---

### Show Team Consistency (4:30 - 6:00)

**Say:**
```
"Here's how KEYS ensures team consistency:

Standardized patterns: Every team using the same Key gets the same proven 
pattern. No variation, no inconsistency, no governance gaps.

Centralized updates: When we update a Key, all teams get the update. You 
don't have multiple versions of the same pattern across teams.

Usage tracking: Enterprise accounts can track which teams use which Keys. 
This supports governance and ensures compliance.

Bundle management: Enterprise teams can purchase bundles that standardize 
patterns across tools. For example, a Security Bundle might include Keys 
for Supabase RLS, GitHub security scanning, and Cursor security patterns.

This creates organizational consistency that reduces risk and supports 
governance."
```

**Do:**
- Show enterprise account features (if available)
- Show bundle options
- Show usage tracking (if available)
- Show team management features

---

### Show Value Proposition (6:00 - 7:00)

**Say:**
```
"Here's the enterprise value proposition:

Time savings: Instead of 8-16 hours per pattern plus security review and 
compliance validation, you get compliance-ready patterns that integrate in 
2-4 hours.

Cost savings: Instead of $1,200-2,400 per pattern for consultants plus 
internal security review, you pay $79-299 for a reusable, compliance-ready Key.

Risk reduction: Enterprise Keys are security-reviewed and compliance-ready. 
You're not experimenting—you're using validated patterns that reduce compliance 
and security risk.

Team consistency: Standardized patterns across teams reduce inconsistency, 
support governance, and ensure compliance.

Compliance support: Audit trails, compliance documentation, and security 
reviews reduce your compliance burden."
```

**Do:**
- Show pricing for enterprise Keys
- Show enterprise tier features
- Show ROI calculation (if available)

---

### Show Integration (7:00 - 7:30)

**Say:**
```
"Enterprise integration is straightforward:

Purchase enterprise Keys or bundles through your enterprise account. Keys 
are downloaded and integrated into your existing workflows. For Supabase 
Keys, that means adding RLS policies to your database. For GitHub Keys, 
that means adding workflows to your repositories.

KEYS doesn't replace your tools—it unlocks capability in tools you already 
use. Your existing infrastructure, your existing workflows, your existing 
governance—KEYS complements them with proven patterns.

Enterprise accounts include SSO support, dedicated support, and custom 
integration assistance if needed."
```

**Do:**
- Show enterprise account features
- Show integration instructions
- Show support options

---

### Closing (7:30 - 8:00)

**Say:**
```
"That's KEYS for enterprise teams. Compliance-ready patterns, security-reviewed 
implementations, team consistency, and proven workflows that save time and 
reduce risk.

We work with tools you already use. We don't replace your infrastructure— 
we unlock capability in it.

## Handling Enterprise Objections

### "We Need Custom Solutions"
**Response:**
```
"KEYS provides proven patterns that you customize for your specific needs. 
Enterprise Keys are structured assets that integrate into your workflows. 
You get the pattern; you apply it to your context. For highly custom 
requirements, KEYS complements consultants by providing proven foundations 
that consultants can build upon."
```

### "We Have Internal Patterns"
**Response:**
```
"Great. KEYS can complement your internal patterns. You might find:
- Patterns you haven't built yet
- Patterns that are better than yours (security-reviewed, compliance-ready)
- Patterns that save you maintenance time (we maintain them)

Plus, KEYS patterns are portable—if you switch tools, you keep the patterns. 
Internal patterns are often tool-specific."
```

### "Compliance Is Our Responsibility"
**Response:**
```
"Absolutely. KEYS reduces your compliance burden by providing compliance-ready 
patterns, security reviews, and audit trail generation. You're still responsible 
for compliance, but KEYS provides proven foundations that reduce your compliance 
workload. Every enterprise Key includes compliance documentation and security 
reviews that support your compliance efforts."
```

### "We Need SLAs"
**Response:**
```
"Enterprise accounts include SLAs, dedicated support, and custom integration 
assistance. We provide uptime guarantees, response time commitments, and 
priority support for enterprise customers. Let's discuss your specific SLA 
requirements."
```

### "We Need On-Premise Deployment"
**Response:**
```
"KEYS Keys are downloadable assets that you integrate into your workflows. 
They're not cloud services—they're patterns you download and use in your 
own infrastructure. For enterprise customers, we can provide private 
distribution channels and on-premise support options."
```
