## Demo Script (3 Minutes)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:15)

**Say:**
```
"KEYS is the keyring to modern tools. You already have powerful tools—Cursor, 
Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe. KEYS provides proven patterns that unlock their full 
potential.

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Do:**
- Open KEYS marketplace
- Navigate to marketplace homepage

---

### Problem Statement (0:15 - 0:30)

**Say:**
```
"Here's the problem: you own Cursor, but you need to build authentication 
middleware. You could spend 8-16 hours researching JWT patterns, testing 
implementations, and debugging edge cases. Or you could hire a consultant 
for $1,200-2,400.

KEYS provides a third option: proven patterns that unlock this capability in 
2-4 hours for $79-299."
```

**Do:**
- Show marketplace search/filter
- Navigate to relevant Key category

---

### Show the Key (0:30 - 1:15)

**Say:**
```
"Here's a Cursor Key: Authentication Scaffolding. This is a prompt pack that 
unlocks JWT authentication middleware generation in Cursor.

Notice what this Key includes:
- Production-tested prompt patterns
- Security-reviewed implementation
- Clear documentation
- Reusable across projects

This isn't just code generation—it's a proven pattern that's been validated 
in real environments."
```

**Do:**
- Click on example Key
- Show Key detail page
- Point out: description, features, pricing, preview
- Scroll through Key metadata (tool, outcome, maturity)

---

### Show the Value (1:15 - 2:00)

**Say:**
```
"Here's the value proposition:

Time savings: Instead of 8-16 hours of research and implementation, you get 
a proven pattern that integrates in 2-4 hours.

Cost savings: Instead of $1,200-2,400 for a consultant, you pay $79-299 
for a reusable Key.

Risk reduction: This pattern is production-tested and security-reviewed. 
You're not experimenting—you're using validated workflows.

Reusability: Once you own this Key, you can use it across multiple projects. 
Consultants provide one-time solutions. KEYS provides reusable assets."
```

**Do:**
- Show pricing on Key page
- Show "Add to Keyring" or purchase flow
- Point out metadata (maturity level, tool, outcome)

---

### Show Discovery (2:00 - 2:30)

**Say:**
```
"KEYS makes discovery easy. You can filter by:
- Tool: Show me all Cursor Keys
- Outcome: Show me all Automation Keys
- Maturity: Show me Starter Keys

Or browse by bundles: Starter Bundle, Operator Bundle, Scale Bundle.

KEYS recommends Keys based on your profile and tools you use. If you use 
Cursor and Stripe, we'll recommend Keys that unlock capability in those tools."
```

**Do:**
- Show marketplace filters
- Filter by tool (Cursor)
- Filter by outcome (Automation)
- Show recommended Keys section (if available)

---

### Integration Preview (2:30 - 2:45)

**Say:**
```
"Once you purchase a Key, you download it and integrate it into your workflow. 
For Cursor Keys, that means adding the prompt pack to your Cursor workspace. 
For Jupyter Keys, that means importing the notebook. For GitHub Keys, that 
means adding the workflow to your repository.

KEYS doesn't replace your tools—it unlocks capability in tools you already own."
```

**Do:**
- Show download/integration instructions (if available)
- Show example of Key structure (if preview available)

---

### Closing (2:45 - 3:00)

**Say:**
```
"That's KEYS in three minutes. Proven patterns that unlock capability in 
tools you already own. Saves time, reduces cost, lowers risk.

Questions?"
```

**Do:**
- Return to marketplace homepage
- Be ready for questions

## Key Talking Points

### Always Emphasize
- **KEYS unlocks tools, doesn't replace them**
- **Proven patterns, not experimental code**
- **Saves 8-16 hours per pattern**
- **Costs $79-299 vs. $1,200-2,400 for consultants**
- **Tool-agnostic, outcome-driven**

### Never Say
- "AI-powered" or "AI magic"
- "Revolutionary" or "game-changing"
- "Replaces [Tool]"
- "Auto-pilot" or "automatic"
- Vague promises

---

## Handling Interruptions

### If Asked About Specific Tools
**Response:**
```
"KEYS works with tools you already own. We have Keys for Cursor, Jupyter, 
GitHub, Stripe, Supabase, and more. If you use a tool, we likely have Keys 
that unlock capability in that tool."
```

### If Asked About Pricing
**Response:**
```
"Keys range from $79-299 individually. Bundles provide discounts. Enterprise 
tiers are available for teams. The value proposition is clear: $79-299 saves 
you 8-16 hours and replaces $1,200-2,400 consultant engagements."
```

### If Asked About Quality
**Response:**
```
"All Keys are production-tested and security-reviewed. They're not experimental— 
they're proven patterns that have been validated in real environments. That's 
the difference between KEYS and building from scratch."
```

### If Asked About Customization
**Response:**
```
"Keys are structured assets that you integrate into your workflow. They're 
reusable and adaptable—you customize them for your specific needs. KEYS provides 
the pattern; you apply it to your context."
```
