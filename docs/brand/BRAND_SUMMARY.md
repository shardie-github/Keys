# Brand System Summary

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: Canonical — This is how KEYS should always sound

---

## The Absolute Truth

**KEYS is the product.**  
**KEYS are the assets.**  
**Keyring is the user's collection.**

KEYS does not replace tools. KEYS unlocks capability in tools users already have.

If language contradicts this, it must be corrected.

## How KEYS Should Sound

### To a Senior Engineer

**"This understands my world."**

KEYS respects technical competence. It doesn't oversell or undersell. It provides proven patterns that unlock capability in tools engineers already use. The language is precise, factual, and helpful—not marketing fluff.

### To an Enterprise Buyer

**"This knows its boundaries."**

KEYS clearly states what it does and what it doesn't do. It doesn't promise to replace tools, teams, or judgment. It provides leverage without risk. The language is confident but not evangelical, clear but not oversimplified.

### To a Founder

**"This gives me leverage without risk."**

KEYS accelerates outcomes without requiring migration or lock-in. It provides proven patterns that save time and reduce risk. The language is practical, outcome-focused, and respectful of constraints.

## Core Messaging

### The One-Liner

**"KEYS is the keyring to modern tools. You already have the tools. Here are the keys to unlock them."**

### The Value Proposition

KEYS is a marketplace of structured assets (notebooks, prompts, workflows, playbooks) that unlock practical, repeatable capability from external tools without competing with them.

### What KEYS Replaces

- Tribal knowledge → Structured patterns
- Glue code → Proven integrations
- Ad-hoc consulting → Validated workflows
- Trial and error → Production-tested approaches

### What KEYS Does NOT Replace

- Tools (Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, etc.)
- Teams (users still need developers, operators)
- Judgment (users decide when and how to use keys)
- Custom development (keys are patterns, not custom solutions)

---

## Language Rules

### ✅ Always Use

- "KEYS" (capitalized) = The product/platform
- "Key/keys" (lowercase) = Assets users purchase
- "Keyring" = User's collection (never the product name)
- "Unlock" language (never "replace")
- "Tools you already own" (assumes existing ownership)

### ❌ Never Use

- "Install KEYS" (KEYS is not installed)
- "KEYS replaces [Tool]" (keys unlock tools, don't replace them)
- "Keyring is the product" (Keyring is the collection)
- "AI-powered" (avoid AI hype)
- "Auto-pilot" (avoid automation hype)
- Superlatives ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "perfect")

---

## Tone Requirements

### Required Tone

- **Factual**: Based on observable reality, not hype
- **Confident**: Clear about what KEYS does and doesn't do
- **Non-evangelical**: No superlatives, no disruption claims
- **Non-disruptive**: KEYS complements tools, doesn't disrupt them
- **Calm**: Reduces anxiety, doesn't create it
- **Respectful**: Assumes user competence

### Forbidden Tone

- Promotional (in technical docs)
- Hype (superlatives, excitement)
- Evangelical ("you should", "you must")
- Condescending ("obviously", "simply")
- Urgent ("now", "immediately")
- Surveillance ("we're watching you")

## The One Test Question

**Before approving any copy, ask:**

**"Does this unlock something the user already owns?"**

If the answer is "no," the copy is wrong.
