## The One Test Question

**Before approving any copy, ask:**

**"Does this unlock something the user already owns?"**

If the answer is "no," the copy is wrong.

---

## Common Language Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confusing KEYS (Product) with Keys (Assets)

**Wrong:**
- "Install KEYS"
- "Use KEYS to build"
- "A KEYS"

**Right:**
- "Get started with KEYS"
- "Use keys to unlock capability"
- "A Key"

**Test:** Is this referring to the product/platform (KEYS) or an asset (Key)? Capitalize accordingly.

---

### Mistake 2: Using Keyring as Product Name

**Wrong:**
- "Keyring is the product"
- "Install Keyring"
- "Keyring marketplace"

**Right:**
- "KEYS is the product"
- "Your Keyring" (user's collection)
- "KEYS marketplace"

**Test:** Is Keyring referring to the user's collection? If not, use KEYS.

---

### Mistake 3: Replacement Language

**Wrong:**
- "KEYS replaces [Tool]"
- "Instead of [Tool], use KEYS"
- "KEYS eliminates the need for [X]"

**Right:**
- "Keys unlock capability in [Tool]"
- "Keys work with [Tool]"
- "Keys reduce the need for [X]"

**Test:** Does this imply replacing a tool? If yes, rewrite to imply unlocking.

---

### Mistake 4: Installation Language

**Wrong:**
- "Install KEYS"
- "Install this Key"
- "Set up KEYS" (unless account setup)

**Right:**
- "Get started with KEYS"
- "Download this Key"
- "Sign up for KEYS" (if account setup)

**Test:** Is this about installing software? Keys are downloaded and integrated, not installed.

---

### Mistake 5: Framework Language

**Wrong:**
- "KEYS framework"
- "Build with KEYS"
- "KEYS platform" (unless referring to infrastructure)

**Right:**
- "KEYS marketplace"
- "Unlock capability with keys"
- "KEYS marketplace" (preferred over "platform")

**Test:** Does this imply KEYS is a framework or execution engine? If yes, rewrite.

---

### Mistake 6: AI Hype

**Wrong:**
- "AI-powered"
- "AI magic"
- "Intelligent automation"
- "Smart recommendations"

**Right:**
- "Pattern-based"
- "Structured workflows"
- "Automated workflows"
- "Recommendations based on your profile"

**Test:** Does this use "AI" as a marketing term? If yes, remove or be specific.

---

### Mistake 7: Automation Hype

**Wrong:**
- "Auto-pilot"
- "Self-healing"
- "Zero-touch"
- "Automatic" (when not accurate)

**Right:**
- "Automated workflows"
- "Structured processes"
- "Reduced manual work"
- "Automated" (only if accurate)

**Test:** Does this promise automation without user involvement? If yes, clarify.

---

### Mistake 8: Superlatives

**Wrong:**
- "Revolutionary"
- "Game-changing"
- "Best"
- "Perfect"
- "Amazing"

**Right:**
- "Proven"
- "Practical"
- "Effective"
- "Validated"
- "Useful"

**Test:** Is this a superlative? If yes, replace with factual language.

---

## How to Evaluate New Copy

### Step 1: The One Test Question

Ask: **"Does this unlock something the user already owns?"**

If no, rewrite.

---

### Step 2: Check Core Definitions

Verify:
- ✅ KEYS = product (capitalized)
- ✅ Key/keys = assets (lowercase)
- ✅ Keyring = user's collection (not product name)
- ✅ "Unlock" language, not "replace"
- ✅ Assumes user owns the tool

---

### Step 3: Check Forbidden Phrases

Scan for:
- ❌ "Install KEYS"
- ❌ "KEYS replaces"
- ❌ "Keyring is the product"
- ❌ "AI-powered" (unless specific)
- ❌ "Auto-pilot"
- ❌ Superlatives

If found, replace using the replacement guide.

---

### Step 4: Check Tone

Verify:
- ✅ Factual, not hype
- ✅ Confident, not evangelical
- ✅ Calm, not urgent
- ✅ Respectful, not condescending

---

### Step 5: Check Boundaries

Verify:
- ✅ KEYS knows what it does
- ✅ KEYS knows what it doesn't do
- ✅ No tool replacement claims
- ✅ No team replacement claims
- ✅ No judgment replacement claims

---

## When Copy Drifts

### If You See Drift

1. **Identify the drift**: What rule is violated?
2. **Find the source**: Where did this copy come from?
3. **Correct immediately**: Use replacement guide
4. **Document the fix**: Note what was wrong and why
5. **Prevent recurrence**: Update process if needed

---

### Common Drift Sources

- **New team members**: Not familiar with brand rules
- **External copywriters**: Not briefed on brand truth
- **AI-generated copy**: May use forbidden phrases
- **Rushed deadlines**: Skipping review process
- **Feature launches**: New features may introduce new language

**Prevention:**
- Brief all copywriters on brand truth
- Review AI-generated copy carefully
- Never skip the review checklist
- Test new feature language against brand rules

---

## Language Evolution

### When Language Can Evolve

Language can evolve when:
- New tools emerge (new "Keys for [Tool]" language)
- New key types emerge (new asset categories)
- User feedback indicates confusion (clarification needed)

### When Language Cannot Evolve

Language cannot evolve when:
- It violates core brand truth
- It implies tool replacement
- It confuses KEYS with keys
- It uses Keyring as product name
- It adds AI hype or automation hype

---

### Who Enforces

- **Product team**: Reviews all product copy
- **Marketing team**: Reviews all marketing copy

- **Sales team**: Reviews all sales materials

### How to Enforce

1. **Review checklist**: Use the checklist for all copy

3. **Brand review**: Escalate unclear cases
4. **Documentation**: Keep brand docs updated

---

## Examples of Drift and Correction

### Example 1: Product Confusion

**Drift:**
```
Install KEYS to get started unlocking tools.
```

**Correction:**
```
Get started with KEYS to unlock capability in tools you already own.
```

**Why:** KEYS is not installed. Users sign up and download keys.

---

### Example 2: Replacement Language

**Drift:**
```
KEYS replaces your need for consultants.
```

**Correction:**
```
KEYS provides proven patterns that complement consultants. Use KEYS for patterns, 
consultants for custom solutions.
```

**Why:** KEYS doesn't replace consultants—it provides patterns that complement them.

---

### Example 3: Keyring Confusion

**Drift:**
```
Keyring is the marketplace for keys.
```

**Correction:**
```
KEYS is the marketplace for keys. Your Keyring is your collection of unlocked keys.
```

**Why:** Keyring is the user's collection, not the product name.

---

### Example 4: AI Hype

**Drift:**
```
AI-powered key recommendations.
```

**Correction:**
```
Key recommendations based on your profile and tool selections.
```

**Why:** Avoid AI hype. Be specific about how recommendations work.
