# Frontend Copy Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: Active — Governs all frontend UI copy  
**Purpose**: Standardized language for homepage, marketplace, CTAs, and all user-facing text

---

## Core Rules

1. **KEYS** (capitalized) = The product/platform
2. **Key/keys** (lowercase) = Assets users purchase
3. **Keyring** = User's collection (never the product name)
4. Always use "unlock" language, never "replace"
5. Always assume users own the tools

that unlock practical, repeatable capability from external tools—without competing with them.
```

### Value Proposition

Cursor Keys
Unlock advanced workflows, prompt patterns, and code generation strategies in Cursor. 
Prompt packs and Composer instructions.
