## 30-Second Pitch

**Standard Version:**
```
KEYS is the keyring to modern tools. We provide proven patterns—prompt packs, 
notebooks, workflows, and playbooks—that unlock practical capability in tools 
you already own: Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, and more. Instead of spending 
8-16 hours researching and building patterns yourself, you can purchase a Key 
for $79-299 and integrate it in 2-4 hours. We're not replacing tools—we're 
unlocking them.
```

**Key Points:**
- KEYS = marketplace of patterns
- Works with tools you own
- Saves 8-16 hours per pattern
- Costs $79-299 vs. $1,200-2,400 for consultants
- Unlocks capability, doesn't replace it

## 60-Second Pitch

**Standard Version:**
```
KEYS is the keyring to modern tools. Here's the problem: developers and 
operators own powerful tools—Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, Supabase—but 
they lack the proven patterns that unlock those tools' full potential.

We solve this with a marketplace of structured assets: prompt packs that 
unlock Cursor workflows, notebooks that unlock Jupyter analysis patterns, 
workflows that unlock GitHub automation, and playbooks that unlock operational 
processes.

Each Key is production-tested, security-reviewed, and saves 8-16 hours of 
research and development time. Instead of hiring consultants at $1,200-2,400 
per pattern, you can purchase a Key for $79-299 and integrate it in 2-4 hours.

KEYS never replaces tools—we unlock capability in tools you already own. We're 
tool-agnostic, outcome-driven, and focused on practical results.

The value proposition is simple: proven patterns, faster integration, lower 
cost, less risk. KEYS is the keyring to modern tools.
```

**Key Points:**
- Problem: Tools are abundant, patterns are scarce
- Solution: Marketplace of proven patterns
- Value: Saves time, reduces cost, lowers risk
- Differentiation: Unlocks tools, doesn't replace them
- Outcome: Practical results faster

## Common Follow-Up Questions

**Q: "How is this different from ChatGPT or Cursor?"**  
A: "ChatGPT and Cursor generate code. KEYS provides production-tested patterns—security-reviewed implementations, compliance-ready workflows, proven runbooks. We provide structure and validation that AI tools don't."

**Q: "Why not build it ourselves?"**  
A: "You absolutely can. KEYS saves you 8-16 hours per pattern. If your team's time is worth $100/hour, that's $800-1,600 saved per pattern. Plus, KEYS patterns are production-tested and security-reviewed—you get proven patterns, not trial-and-error."

**Q: "What if we don't use those tools?"**  
A: "KEYS works with tools you already own. We don't replace tools—we unlock them. If you use Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, or Supabase, we have Keys that unlock capability in those tools. We're tool-agnostic."

**Q: "How do you compete with free alternatives?"**  
A: "Free alternatives require research, testing, and maintenance. KEYS provides production-tested patterns that are security-reviewed and compliance-ready. You're paying for validation, not just code."
