# Canonical Definitions

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: IMMUTABLE — Source of Truth  
**Purpose**: Precise definitions that govern all copy, UI, docs, and sales materials

## The Absolute Rule

**KEYS is the product.**  
**KEYS are the assets.**  
**Keyring is the user's collection.**

If language contradicts this, it must be corrected.

## Core Definitions

### KEYS (The Product)

**KEYS** is a marketplace of structured assets (notebooks, prompts, workflows, playbooks) that unlock practical, repeatable capability in external tools without competing with them. KEYS is the keyring to modern tools—the platform that hosts and distributes keys. KEYS is not an AI tool, not a tool replacement, and not a platform lock-in. It is the marketplace and infrastructure that enables users to discover, purchase, and use keys.

**Usage Rules:**
- ✅ "KEYS is the keyring to modern tools"
- ✅ "Browse KEYS marketplace"
- ✅ "KEYS unlocks capability"
- ❌ "Install KEYS" (KEYS is not installed, keys are downloaded)
- ❌ "Use KEYS" (ambiguous—use KEYS the product or keys the assets?)

---

### A Key (An Asset)

**A Key** is a structured, validated, reusable asset that unlocks a specific, practical outcome in an external tool. A key might be a prompt pack, notebook, workflow template, playbook, or guide. Each key targets a specific tool (Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, etc.) and unlocks a specific capability within that tool. Keys are purchased, downloaded, and owned by users. Keys are not executed by KEYS—they are used by users within their own tools.

**Usage Rules:**
- ✅ "This Key unlocks Stripe subscription management"
- ✅ "Add this Key to your Keyring"
- ✅ "Download the Key"
- ✅ "Keys for Cursor" (plural, referring to multiple assets)
- ❌ "A KEYS" (confuses product with asset)
- ❌ "Install a Key" (keys are downloaded and integrated, not installed)

---

### Keyring (User's Collection)

**Keyring** is the user's owned collection of keys. It is not the product name. It is the conceptual container for keys a user has purchased or unlocked. A user's keyring grows as they acquire more keys. The keyring metaphor reinforces that keys unlock tools the user already owns—just as a physical keyring holds keys that unlock doors.

**Usage Rules:**
- ✅ "Your Keyring includes 5 keys"
- ✅ "Add this Key to your Keyring"
- ✅ "View your Keyring"
- ✅ "Keys in your Keyring"
- ❌ "Keyring is the product" (Keyring is the collection, KEYS is the product)
- ❌ "Install Keyring" (Keyring is not installed, it's a collection concept)

---

### Bundles

**Bundles** are curated collections of multiple keys sold together at a discounted price. Bundles are organized by theme (Starter Bundle, Operator Bundle) or by tool (Cursor Keys Bundle, Jupyter Keys Bundle). Purchasing a bundle adds all included keys to the user's keyring. Bundles provide value through convenience and cost savings compared to purchasing keys individually.

**Usage Rules:**
- ✅ "Purchase the Starter Bundle"
- ✅ "This bundle includes 5 keys"
- ✅ "Save 20% with this bundle"
- ❌ "Bundle of KEYS" (confuses product with assets—say "bundle of keys")

---

### Discovery

**Discovery** is the process by which KEYS recommends keys to users based on their profile, role, intent, or browsing behavior. Discovery is not surveillance—it is explicit, transparent, and user-controlled. Discovery recommendations explain why a key is suggested (e.g., "Because you use Cursor" or "Because you're building a SaaS product"). Users can ignore, dismiss, or act on discovery recommendations.

**Usage Rules:**
- ✅ "Discover keys for your workflow"
- ✅ "Recommended for you: [reason]"
- ✅ "Discovery recommendations"
- ❌ "We're watching you" (discovery is explicit, not surveillance)
- ❌ "AI-powered discovery" (avoid AI hype—discovery is recommendation logic)

---

### Entitlements

**Entitlements** are the user's purchased or unlocked access to specific keys. An entitlement grants perpetual access to download and use a key. Entitlements are tied to the user's account and persist across sessions. Entitlements can be purchased individually, through bundles, or via subscription tiers that grant access to all keys.

**Usage Rules:**
- ✅ "You have an entitlement to this Key"
- ✅ "Check your entitlements"
- ✅ "Unlock this Key" (purchase an entitlement)
- ❌ "License" (entitlements are access rights, not licenses—though keys may have licenses)
- ❌ "Ownership" (users own access, not the key itself)

---

## Distinction Rules

### KEYS vs. Keys

- **KEYS** (capitalized) = The product/platform/marketplace
- **Keys** (plural, lowercase) = Multiple assets
- **Key** (singular, lowercase) = A single asset

**Examples:**
- ✅ "KEYS is the keyring to modern tools"
- ✅ "Browse keys in the marketplace"
- ✅ "This Key unlocks Cursor workflows"
- ❌ "KEYS unlock tools" (should be "Keys unlock tools" or "KEYS enables you to unlock tools")

---

### Keyring vs. KEYS

- **Keyring** = User's collection (conceptual)
- **KEYS** = The product/platform

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Your Keyring has 5 keys"
- ✅ "KEYS is the marketplace"
- ❌ "Keyring is the product" (KEYS is the product, Keyring is the collection)

---

### Unlock vs. Replace

- **Unlock** = Enable capability in an existing tool
- **Replace** = Substitute for a tool (forbidden)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "This Key unlocks Stripe subscription management"
- ✅ "Keys unlock capability in tools you already own"
- ❌ "This Key replaces Stripe" (keys never replace tools)
- ❌ "KEYS replaces your tools" (KEYS never replaces tools)

---

### Download vs. Install

- **Download** = Get the key asset files
- **Install** = Set up software (not applicable to keys)

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Download this Key"
- ✅ "Download the key files"
- ❌ "Install this Key" (keys are downloaded and integrated, not installed)

---

## Enforcement Rules

### When Writing Copy

1. **Check capitalization**: Is this the product (KEYS) or an asset (Key/keys)?
2. **Check Keyring usage**: Is Keyring used as the collection concept, not the product?
3. **Check unlock language**: Does this imply unlocking capability, not replacing tools?
4. **Check tool assumption**: Does this assume the user already has the tool?

### When Evaluating New Copy

Ask these questions:
1. Does this use KEYS correctly (product vs. asset)?
2. Does this use Keyring correctly (collection vs. product)?
3. Does this imply unlocking, not replacing?
4. Does this assume the user owns the tool?

If any answer is "no," the copy is wrong.
