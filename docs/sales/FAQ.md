## Product Questions

### What Is KEYS?

**Answer:**
```
KEYS is the keyring to modern tools. We provide a marketplace of proven patterns— 
prompt packs, notebooks, workflows, playbooks—that unlock practical capability 
in tools you already own: Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, Supabase, and more.

KEYS never replaces tools. We unlock capability in tools you already use.
```

### What Is a Key?

**Answer:**
```
A Key is a structured, validated, reusable asset that unlocks a specific, 
practical outcome in an external tool. A Key might be:
- A prompt pack that unlocks Cursor workflows
- A notebook that unlocks Jupyter analysis patterns
- A workflow that unlocks GitHub automation
- A playbook that unlocks operational processes

Each Key is production-tested, security-reviewed, and saves 8-16 hours of 
research and implementation time.

### How Is KEYS Different from ChatGPT/Cursor?

**Answer:**
```
ChatGPT and Cursor generate code and provide assistance. KEYS provides proven 
patterns that are production-tested and security-reviewed.

ChatGPT generates code. Cursor assists with coding. KEYS provides structured 
assets—prompt packs, notebooks, workflows—that unlock capability in tools 
you already own.

The difference: KEYS provides validation and structure that AI tools don't.
```

---

### Does KEYS Replace My Tools?

**Answer:**
```
No. KEYS never replaces tools. We unlock capability in tools you already own.

For example, a Cursor Key unlocks advanced workflows in Cursor—it doesn't 
replace Cursor. A Jupyter Key unlocks analysis patterns in Jupyter—it doesn't 
replace Jupyter.

KEYS amplifies your tools. We don't replace them.

## Pricing Questions

### How Much Do Keys Cost?

**Answer:**
```
Keys range from $79-299 individually. Bundles provide 20-40% discounts. 
Subscriptions are available: Pro tier ($29/month), Enterprise (custom pricing).

The value proposition: $79-299 saves you 8-16 hours and replaces $1,200-2,400 
consultant engagements.
```

### Why Should I Pay When I Can Build It Myself?

**Answer:**
```
You absolutely can build it yourself. Here's the question: is your time worth 
more than the cost of a Key?

Building a pattern from scratch takes 8-16 hours: research, implementation, 
testing, security review, documentation. If your time is worth $100/hour, 
that's $800-1,600. A Key costs $79-299 and saves you that time.

Plus, KEYS patterns are production-tested and security-reviewed. You're not 
just paying for code—you're paying for validation.

### Do Keys Work with My Existing Setup?

**Answer:**
```
Yes. KEYS Keys are designed to work with tools you already own. They integrate 
into your existing workflows, not replace them.

For example, a Cursor Key adds prompt patterns to your Cursor workspace. 
A Jupyter Key imports a notebook into your Jupyter environment. A GitHub 
Key adds a workflow to your repository.

KEYS works with your existing setup. We don't require migration or platform 
changes.

review security best practices, and document risk mitigation strategies.
