**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: Canonical — Use for investor presentations  
**Purpose**: Slide-by-slide narrative for investor pitch deck

## Deck Structure (10-12 Slides)

### Slide 1: Title Slide

**Visual:**
- KEYS logo
- Tagline: "The keyring to modern tools"
- Your name, title, contact

**Narrative:**
```
"Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm [Name], [Title] at KEYS. Today I'm going to 
show you how KEYS unlocks practical capability in modern development tools 
through a marketplace of proven patterns."
```

---

### Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual:**
- Tools vs. Patterns diagram
- Statistics: 8-16 hours per pattern, $1,200-2,400 consultant cost

**Narrative:**
```
"Here's the problem: developers own powerful tools—Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, 
Stripe, Supabase—but they lack the proven patterns that unlock those tools' 
full potential.

Building patterns from scratch takes 8-16 hours: research, implementation, 
testing, security review. Hiring consultants costs $1,200-2,400 per pattern. 
This creates a capability gap: tools are abundant, patterns are scarce."
```

**Key Points:**
- Tools are abundant, patterns are scarce
- Time cost: 8-16 hours per pattern
- Financial cost: $1,200-2,400 per pattern
- Capability gap exists

---

### Slide 3: The Solution

**Visual:**
- KEYS marketplace screenshot
- Key examples: Cursor Keys, Jupyter Keys, Stripe Keys

**Narrative:**
```
"KEYS solves this with a marketplace of structured assets: prompt packs that 
unlock Cursor workflows, notebooks that unlock Jupyter analysis patterns, 
workflows that unlock GitHub automation, and playbooks that unlock operational 
processes.

Each Key is production-tested, security-reviewed, and saves 8-16 hours. Instead 
of $1,200-2,400 for consultants, Keys cost $79-299 and integrate in 2-4 hours.

KEYS never replaces tools—we unlock capability in tools users already own."
```

**Key Points:**
- Marketplace of structured assets
- Production-tested, security-reviewed
- Saves 8-16 hours per pattern
- Costs $79-299 vs. $1,200-2,400
- Unlocks tools, doesn't replace them

---

### Slide 4: The Market

**Visual:**
- Market size: TAM, SAM, SOM
- Growth trends: tool adoption, developer spending

**Narrative:**
```
"The market is large and growing. Every developer using modern tools needs 
patterns. TAM is $50B+ (all developers using modern tools). SAM is $10B+ 
(developers using AI tools for code generation). SOM is $100M+ (developers 
who need proven patterns).

Market trends:
- Tool proliferation: new tools emerge constantly
- Pattern scarcity: proven patterns are hard to find
- Cost pressure: consultants are expensive
- Time pressure: developers need faster solutions

KEYS addresses all four trends."
```

**Key Points:**
- Large market: $50B+ TAM
- Growing market: tool adoption increasing
- Clear need: pattern scarcity
- Addressable: $100M+ SOM

---

### Slide 5: Product Demo

**Visual:**
- Marketplace screenshots
- Key detail page
- Integration workflow

**Narrative:**
```
"Let me show you how KEYS works. [Live demo or screenshots]

Users browse the marketplace, filter by tool, outcome, or maturity level. 
They find a Key that unlocks the capability they need. They purchase it for 
$79-299, download it, and integrate it into their workflow in 2-4 hours.

The Key is reusable across projects. It's production-tested and security-reviewed. 
Users get proven patterns, not experimental code."
```

**Key Points:**
- Easy discovery: filter by tool, outcome, maturity
- Simple purchase: $79-299 per Key
- Fast integration: 2-4 hours
- Reusable: works across projects

---

### Slide 6: Business Model

**Visual:**
- Pricing tiers: Free, Pro, Enterprise
- Revenue streams: individual Keys, bundles, subscriptions

**Narrative:**
```
"KEYS has multiple revenue streams:

Individual Keys: $79-299 per Key, one-time purchase
Bundles: Curated collections with 20-40% discounts
Subscriptions: Pro tier ($29/month), Enterprise (custom pricing)

Unit economics:
- CAC: $50 (content marketing, product-led growth)
- LTV: $1,740 (Pro: $29/month × 60 months retention)
- LTV:CAC: 35:1
- Gross Margin: 75-90% (improves with scale)

Why price won't collapse: structural cost floor ($29/month covers insurance, 
legal, compliance), outcome-based pricing (anchored to $10K-$100K+ prevented), 
data gravity (failure patterns accumulate)."
```

**Key Points:**
- Multiple revenue streams
- Strong unit economics: 35:1 LTV:CAC
- High gross margins: 75-90%
- Price stability: structural cost floor

### Slide 7: Competitive Moat

**Visual:**
- Moat diagram: discoverability, quality, tool-agnostic positioning

**Narrative:**
```
"KEYS has three defensible moats:

First, discoverability moat. Clean taxonomy (tool, outcome, maturity) makes 
discovery trivial. Competitors without taxonomy struggle with discovery. 
Users find what they need faster.

Second, quality moat. Production-tested, security-reviewed patterns. Not 
experimental code—validated workflows. Competitors can't match quality 
without significant investment.

Third, tool-agnostic positioning. KEYS works with tools users already own. 
We don't compete with tools—we amplify them. This creates sustainable, 
non-zero-sum relationships with tool vendors.

Combined, these moats create defensible positioning that scales with tool 
proliferation."
```

**Key Points:**
- Discoverability moat: clean taxonomy
- Quality moat: production-tested patterns
- Positioning moat: tool-agnostic
- Defensible: scales with tool proliferation
