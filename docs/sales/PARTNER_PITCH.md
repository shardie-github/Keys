## Partner Objections

### "You're Competing with Us"
**Response:**
```
"Actually, we're amplifying you. KEYS provides patterns that unlock capability 
in [Partner Tool/Platform]—we don't replace it. Users who use KEYS with 
[Partner Tool/Platform] get more value from [Partner Tool/Platform]. That's 
complementary, not competitive."
```

### "We Can Build This Ourselves"
**Response:**
```
"You absolutely can. But KEYS focuses on patterns across tools, not just 
[Partner Tool/Platform]. We provide tool-agnostic patterns that work with 
multiple tools. That's our differentiation: we're not tool-specific, 
we're pattern-focused."
```

### "Our Users Don't Need This"
**Response:**
```
"Let's test that. We can run a pilot program with a subset of your users 
and measure adoption, satisfaction, and engagement. If users don't need 
KEYS, we'll know. If they do, we'll have data to support the partnership."
```
