## Example: Product Launch Press Release

### For Immediate Release

**KEYS Launches Marketplace of Proven Patterns for Modern Development Tools**

**Marketplace provides production-tested patterns that unlock capability in Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, and more**

**[CITY, STATE] — [DATE] — KEYS, the keyring to modern tools, today announced 
the launch of its marketplace of proven patterns for modern development tools.**

KEYS provides a marketplace of structured assets—prompt packs, notebooks, 
workflows, playbooks—that unlock practical capability in tools developers 
already own: Cursor, Jupyter, GitHub, Stripe, Supabase, and more.

"Developers own powerful tools but lack the proven patterns that unlock their 
full potential," said [Founder Name], [Title] at KEYS. "KEYS solves this by 
providing production-tested patterns that save 8-16 hours per pattern and 
cost $79-299 vs. $1,200-2,400 for consultants."

KEYS Keys are production-tested, security-reviewed, and save developers 
8-16 hours of research and implementation time. Instead of hiring consultants 
at $1,200-2,400 per pattern, developers can purchase a Key for $79-299 and 
integrate it in 2-4 hours.

"KEYS never replaces tools—we unlock capability in tools developers already 
own," said [Founder Name]. "We're tool-agnostic, outcome-driven, and focused 
on practical results."

The KEYS marketplace includes Keys for:
- Cursor: Prompt packs that unlock advanced workflows
- Jupyter: Notebooks that unlock data science patterns
- GitHub: Workflows that unlock automation
- Stripe: Patterns that unlock subscription management
- Supabase: Patterns that unlock database and auth flows

KEYS Keys are reusable across projects, production-tested, and security-reviewed. 
Enterprise Keys include compliance documentation, audit trail generation, 
and security reviews.

KEYS never replaces tools—we unlock capability in tools users already own.
