## What KEYS Does NOT Claim

### ❌ KEYS Does NOT:
- Replace custom architecture (KEYS provides patterns, not architecture)
- Replace domain expertise (KEYS provides structure, not domain knowledge)
- Replace security audits (KEYS provides secure patterns, not audit guarantees)
- Replace compliance reviews (KEYS provides compliance-ready patterns, not legal advice)
- Replace testing (KEYS provides tested patterns, but you must test your integration)

### ✅ KEYS DOES:
- Provide proven patterns (production-tested)
- Save time (structured implementation vs. research)
- Reduce risk (security-reviewed, compliance-aware)
- Accelerate delivery (faster time to value)
- Enable consistency (standardized patterns across team)

---

## Trust-First Framing

### Conservative Claims
- **Hours Saved**: Conservative estimates (actual may be higher)
- **Risk Avoided**: Based on industry averages (actual may vary)
- **Cost Comparison**: Based on typical rates (actual may vary)

### No Inflated Numbers
- **No "10x productivity" claims** (we don't know your context)
- **No "guaranteed ROI" claims** (results depend on usage)
- **No "magic bullet" claims** (KEYS is a tool, not a solution)

### Honest Positioning
- **KEYS is a tool**: It helps, but you still need to use it correctly
- **KEYS is a pattern library**: It provides structure, not magic
- **KEYS is a time-saver**: It accelerates, but doesn't eliminate work

---

## Conclusion

KEYS provides **proven patterns** that replace:
- **Consultant engagements** (85-95% cost savings)
- **In-house development** (70-85% cost savings)
- **Component libraries** (break-even in 1-2 years)
